::: STRUCTURE OF MIND AND WORKING ITERATION 1:::

	
[A]	Brain effectively work on Feelings which are exclusive to the brain. It orgainizes and store
	each data in memory primarily based on most prominent feeling it can associate with or as exceptions
	when can't decide or find any past history. sort of like a ven-diagram for happiness, sadness and 
	intersect them to create new mixed feeling. 
	
[B] Effective e.g. for Brain's memory management system. 
	We know that giggle, smile, tickle etc. are pre-associated with happiness and reference each other 
	as well. therefore, if someone says a joke the underlying idea is referenced to the happiness. While 
	the real joke and its linguistic components are stored seperetly as sentence while handling 
	communication part of the process. 
	
	A Bad day, An unpleasent dream/Night mare are all associated with sadness as they hamper happiness
	are all of them pre-associated with something not-good and good as noun is also associated with happiness.
	Now, the question why they are associated with sadness why not any other feeling. 
	
	The Answer is brain first handles a binary checks before processing anything: It checks 
	if the information(auditory/print) satisfies what desired/expectation. if it follows a patter. If it follows
	a trend based on previous experience(for this it assumes one feeling and finds the underlying 
	context and searches for all the symbolic references to the <feeling, context> key value pair.
	and iterates until it finds something mathching). All this as false and narrowed trend returns negetive 
	then brain add this information's idea and involved nouns(assuming new) to the sadness directory.
	
	The Mixed feeling is something doesn't exist in IRL but only as a logical perspective of mind. 
	For e.g. happiness and sadness mixed feeling are unique in reality. One of the most prominent
	example being when an indivisual outperform himself and but misses it by a nick margin.
	this kicks both the feelings at once which are complex equaly complex to process these inside brain.

::: BRAIN HACKS :::

[A]	Brain has something called context remapping or soft-reset in lamen terms. Using the above 
	Technique indivisual can change or add a new context to a memory in a controled manner. 

[B] When Tried to strongly desire a change by constantly imagining the changes in detail frequently
	going aginst the brain. The brain constantly breaks the previous connections and make new connection
	effectively remaps the memory with new data and removing prevously un-Anchored data. This is similar 
	to how soft-reset on phones/devices work these days.
