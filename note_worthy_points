***quotes***

"In almost any subject, your passion for the subject will save you 
 If you care enough for the result you will most certainly attain it.
 If you wish to be good, you will be good.
 If you wish to be rich, you will be rich.
 If you wish to be learned, you will be learned.
 
 Only then you must really wish these things and wish them
 exclusiveness and not wish one hundred other incompatible things
 just as strongly."
					by William James, Harvard Uninversity.

::: POINTS TO REMEMBER :::

[1] Emphasis on the words you find prominent in a sentence and not 
	emphasize on others which you don't want others to pay attention on.

[2] This way of talking to helps increases the chances of devoting the massage 
	correctly to others and decrease the chance of mis-communication.

[3] Talking to your self while putting Empahasis on words will help for e.g. rather than 
	saying 'tommorow i am gonna do this thing' say it something like 'tommorow i am 
	*definately going to* **achieve** this thing'. will help you increase your morale 
	and chances of actually perfoming that action.
	
[4] "Because" is the most prominent word for excuse in any language. With becuase any Lame 
	Excuse suddenly looks more interesting rather than saying like "i am in a hurry can you 
	do _" has more chances of rejection than saying "Can you do _ for me becuase, I am in
	a little hurry".
	
[5]	Strong thinking and vivid imagination for a particular CONTEXT could help you figure out 
	weak areas, change your nature regarding context according to the amount of desire in your
	thinking. Given the context should be feasible to the indivisual.
